## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for "ORDINE DEI COPYWRITER ESTINTI" (Order of Extinct Copywriters), an Italian email marketing agency website. The application features a modern React frontend with an Express.js backend, implementing sophisticated animations, responsive design, and form handling capabilities.

## System Architecture

The application follows a monorepo structure with clear separation between client and server code:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Vite bundler
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript 
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Library**: Custom components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Animation System**: Custom CSS animations with particle effects, morphing cards, and typewriter effects
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with extensive breakpoint management
- **Theming**: CSS variables for consistent color scheme and spacing

### Backend Architecture
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for form submissions
- **Data Layer**: Drizzle ORM with type-safe database operations
- **Storage Strategy**: Configurable storage interface supporting both in-memory and PostgreSQL implementations
- **Request Handling**: Express middleware for JSON parsing, logging, and error handling

### Database Schema
Three main entities:
1. **Users**: Basic user authentication structure
2. **Diagnosis Requests**: Free consultation form submissions
3. **Contact Submissions**: Detailed contact form with business information

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: Forms submit via TanStack Query mutations
2. **API Processing**: Express routes validate data using Zod schemas
3. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM handles type-safe database interactions
4. **Response Handling**: Standardized JSON responses with error handling
5. **UI Updates**: React Query manages cache invalidation and UI state

## External Dependencies

### Core Framework Dependencies
- **React 18**: Frontend framework with modern hooks
- **Express**: Backend web framework
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database toolkit
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management

### UI and Styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible component primitives
- **Lucide React**: Icon library
- **shadcn/ui**: Pre-built component library

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and dev server
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the stack
- **ESBuild**: Production build optimization

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for Replit deployment with:

- **Development**: `npm run dev` starts both frontend and backend
- **Build Process**: Vite builds frontend, ESBuild bundles backend
- **Production**: Serves static files and API from single Express server
- **Port Configuration**: External port 80 maps to internal port 5000
- **Auto-scaling**: Configured for autoscale deployment target

The build process creates optimized production bundles with the frontend assets served statically and the backend running as a Node.js application.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Deployment preference: Needs complete deployment guide for production hosting with database and file uploads.
